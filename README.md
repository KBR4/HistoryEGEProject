## Description

The Unified State Examination in history has been taking place for quite a long time, and some tasks, and in particular tasks with maps, require more effective preparation. An application that includes these tasks would greatly help students in grades 10-11 in preparing for the exam.

## How to start testing

1. On the main page, go to the "Выбрать тест" tab.
